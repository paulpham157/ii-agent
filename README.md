## Introduction

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2707b106-f37d-41a8-beff-8802b1c9b186>

## Overview

II Agent is built around providing an agentic interface to leading language models. It offers:

- A CLI interface for direct command-line interaction
- A WebSocket server that powers a modern React-based frontend
- Integration with multiple LLM providers:
  - Anthropic Claude models (direct API or via Google Cloud Vertex AI)
  - Google Gemini models (direct API or via Google Cloud Vertex AI)

## GAIA Benchmark Evaluation

II-Agent has been evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, which assesses LLM-based agents operating within realistic scenarios across multiple dimensions including multimodal processing, tool utilization, and web searching.

We identified several issues with the GAIA benchmark during our evaluation:

- **Annotation Errors**: Several incorrect annotations in the dataset (e.g., misinterpreting date ranges, calculation errors)
- **Outdated Information**: Some questions reference websites or content no longer accessible
- **Language Ambiguity**: Unclear phrasing leading to different interpretations of questions

Despite these challenges, II-Agent demonstrated strong performance on the benchmark, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning.

## Requirements

- Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- At least one of the following:
  - Anthropic API key, or
  - Google Gemini API key, or
  - Google Cloud project with Vertex AI API enabled

> \[!TIP]
>
> - For best performance, we recommend using Claude 4.0 Sonnet or Claude Opus 4.0 models.
> - For fast and cheap, we recommend using GPT4.1 from OpenAI.
> - Gemini 2.5 Pro is a good balance between performance and cost.

## Environment

You need to set up `.env` files to run frontend.

**Shortcut:** Check file `.env.example` for example of `.env` file.

For the frontend, create a `.env` file in the frontend directory, point to the port of your backend:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key> # Optional, for Google Drive integration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your_google_client_id> # Optional, for Google Drive integration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_google_client_secret> # Optional, for Google Drive integration
```

## Installation

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the environment as mentioned in the above step
3. If you are using Anthropic Client run

```
docker compose up
```
Our II-Agent supports popular models such as Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI. If you’d like to use a model from OpenRouter, simply configure your OpenAI endpoint with your OpenRouter API key.
If you are using Vertex, run with these variables

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=absolute-path-to-credential docker compose up
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Python environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Set up frontend (optional):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Web Interface

1. Start the WebSocket server:

When using Anthropic client:

```bash
STATIC_FILE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 python ws_server.py --port 8000
```

When using Vertex:

```bash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path-to-your-credential STATIC_FILE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 python ws_server.py --port 8000
```

2. Start the frontend (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
